## Inspiration

In a world where corporations are responsible for up to 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it's crucial to address the root of climate change: consumer support for these corporations. Our extension directly empowers consumers with a source of objective information to make informed, sustainable choices amidst a sea of corporate misinformation in the fast-paced online landscape.

## What it does

Climate Criminals is a browser extension that uses a sophisticated algorithm **to identify and highlight** unsustainable companies that are contributing to climate change as you browse. In doing so, it points out a specific, objective facet of their behaviour that is contributing to climate change and even supports this information with a link. The extension also suggests eco-friendly alternatives and supports reliability through accessing the Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index 2023 and recent news sources.

## How we built it

Developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into

Allowing for a clean highlighting feature was quite challenging. Took a lengthy process and had to learn OOP Javascript which I didn't really know how to do.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Clean, functional product that should be very helpful in guiding users towards more sustainable habits. An idea that doesn't widely exist elsewhere and could make a real impact.

## What we learned

Much about Javascript: visual design and OOP mechanisms.

## What's next for Climate Criminals

Further bolstering data accuracy; potentially incorporating personalized suggestions based on the company being highlighted at the moment (e.g. if  is being highlighted on the given page the user is browsing, the extension popup page would show a personalized sustainable tech company that sells the same types of products  sells).
